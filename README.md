# portfolio

was watching one of the GOAT [hero's journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey) films, [Gladiator](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172495/) last night and i still cant get enough of it even after many rewatches over the years. That peace as the camera pans to the sky with that music, that's easily the most satisfying ending of all time. So i decided to rework my portfolio to be like it

this was still the initial experimental version of the portfolio
